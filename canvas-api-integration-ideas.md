# Canvas API Ideas for Course and Material Creation Pipelines

> [!NOTE]
> ```Extensions, pipelines and project ideas to leverage Canvas' developer API (without the technical jargon)```
>
> To enhance course creation and management at our institution, we can leverage the open-source capabilities of Canvas. By customizing Canvas to fit our specific needs, we can streamline administrative processes, improve efficiency for faculty, and ensure consistency across courses. Below are some practical tools that will empower faculty and staff while reducing the complexity of course management.

### **1. Simplified Course Creation Tool**

- **What it does**: This tool allows faculty to quickly create and organize course materials without needing technical expertise. It provides an easy-to-use interface for setting up courses, organizing lessons, and uploading resources.
- **Why it matters**: It saves instructors time and ensures that courses are consistently structured, reducing the effort required to set up new courses.

### **2. Automatic Course Updates**

- **What it does**: This system automatically keeps course materials—such as assignments and links—up to date. If an external resource or link changes, the system will automatically update it in Canvas.
- **Why it matters**: Keeps course content fresh and accurate without requiring manual intervention, allowing instructors to focus on teaching rather than administrative tasks.

### **3. Accessibility Checker for Course Materials**

- **What it does**: This tool scans course materials for accessibility issues (e.g., missing image descriptions, unreadable text) and automatically suggests fixes to ensure inclusivity.
- **Why it matters**: Helps faculty ensure that all students, including those with disabilities, can fully engage with course content, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.

### **4. Live and Automatic Syllabus Pulling from Canvas Course**

- **What it does**: The live syllabus automatically updates with any changes in Canvas, such as new assignments, quizzes, or **due dates**. An auto-generated syllabus can pull course details like assignments, deadlines, and readings from Canvas to create a fully formatted syllabus with minimal input from faculty.
  
- **Why it matters**:
  - **Auto-Updates**: Faculty no longer need to manually adjust the syllabus whenever a change occurs in Canvas, saving time and reducing errors.
  - **Centralized, Consistent Information**: Both features pull information directly from Canvas, ensuring the syllabus is always accurate and up-to-date for both faculty and students.
  - **Easy Access**: Faculty and students can access the live syllabus in real-time, ensuring they are always working with the most current version. The auto-generated syllabus provides a clear starting point for course planning, ensuring consistency across courses.

### **5. Markdown-Driven Canvas Course Generator**

- **What it does**: Professors can define the course syllabus and structure in markdown (MD) format, which is then parsed to automatically create an entire Canvas course skeleton. This includes generating folders, pages, and modules based on the content specified in the markdown file. The markdown file can also include links to content such as assignments, readings, and media, providing a fully automated draft of the course structure.

- **Why it matters**:
  - **Streamlined Course Creation**: Professors can define the course layout and content in a single markdown file, which is then used to generate an organized Canvas course shell, saving significant time in course setup.
  - **Customizable Template**: Professors can use the markdown as a template that automatically organizes course materials into the appropriate Canvas structure. This allows for easy customization or reuse for future courses.
  - **Easy Deployment**: Once parsed, the markdown file creates a fully populated course skeleton, meaning professors can either use it as is or make minimal adjustments. This reduces the need for manual setup of folders, pages, modules, and linking content in Canvas.

### **6. Canvas Course Backup and Conversion**

- **What it does**: This feature allows administrators to back up existing Canvas courses off the platform by converting them into a simple, editable format. The tool captures all course content—such as pages, assignments, quizzes, and media—and creates a repository that can be used for future courses or stored as a backup.

- **Why it matters**:
  - **Course Continuity**: Professors can easily preserve their course structure and content, making it simple to reuse or update for future semesters.
  - **Simplifies Maintenance**: Once the course is converted, professors can quickly make changes without having to navigate through Canvas each time. It’s easier to update or adjust course content in the future.
  - **Long-term Access**: The file format is simple and easy to store, making it easy to revisit and modify the course whenever needed.
  - **Easy Transition**: For instructors who have used Canvas’s built-in tools or HTML, this feature makes it easy to transition to a more organized and maintainable structure for future courses.

### **7. Seamless Content Import from External Platforms**

- **What it does**: This tool allows faculty to easily import content from external systems (e.g., **Panopto**, OneDrive, Sharepoint) directly into Canvas, automatically organizing and structuring the materials.
  - **Example**: An ordered collection of video files of lecture recordings, turned into a course index or topic-specific wiki/reference page.
- **Why it matters**: Simplifies the content migration process, reducing the technical burden on faculty and allowing them to focus on the teaching content rather than the technical details.
