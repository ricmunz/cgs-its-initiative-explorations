# Panopto-Canvas Integration via API Examples

> [!NOTE]
>
> Here are several real-world application examples where **Panopto** and **Canvas** can work together to enhance course materials, leveraging Panopto's video hosting and management features:


<br>

### 1. **Automatic Video Embedding and Linking**

- **Application**: A custom tool that automatically embeds or links Panopto videos directly into Canvas course pages based on course materials or lecture topics.
- **How it works**:
  - When an instructor uploads a new video in Panopto, a script or tool could automatically place it within the appropriate section or module in the Canvas course, ensuring students can easily access video content related to their current lessons.
  - The tool could also create direct links to specific video folders on Panopto, allowing students to access a series of videos relevant to their course.

### 2. **Lecture Recording and Auto-Upload**

- **Application**: A tool that facilitates automatic recording and uploading of in-class lectures or presentations to Panopto and links them to Canvas.
- **How it works**:
  - Faculty can use Panopto to record live lectures, which are then automatically uploaded to their Panopto account. The tool would then push the recording into the appropriate Canvas course folder.
  - This integration can include metadata like course name, date, and topics covered, which would make it easy for students to find the right lectures in Canvas.

### 3. **Personalized Video Recommendations Based on Student Progress**

- **Application**: A recommendation engine within Canvas that suggests relevant Panopto videos based on a student's progress in the course.
- **How it works**:
  - As students engage with course materials, the system analyzes their activity (e.g., assignments submitted, quizzes passed) and suggests Panopto videos that reinforce or expand on those topics.
  - For example, if a student struggles with a certain concept on an exam, the tool could recommend related tutorial videos from Panopto that help clarify the material.

### 4. **Video-based Quizzes and Assessments**

- **Application**: Panopto videos integrated with quizzes or interactive assignments in Canvas.
- **How it works**:
  - After students watch a video hosted on Panopto, a custom Canvas tool could trigger a quiz or reflection assignment based on the video content.
  - For example, after watching a recorded lecture or demonstration, the student may be asked to answer questions to assess their understanding or apply concepts in the video. This ensures active engagement with the video content.

### 5. **Real-Time Video Analytics for Faculty and Administrators**

- **Application**: An analytics dashboard in Canvas that aggregates and visualizes how students engage with video content from Panopto.
- **How it works**:
  - Faculty could see data on how many students have viewed each Panopto video, how long they watched, and whether they watched it in full.
  - If students tend to skip certain sections, the instructor can receive alerts and adjust the content or provide additional materials.
  - Administrators can also monitor overall video usage across courses and ensure content is being fully utilized.

### 6. **Student-Generated Video Content**

- **Application**: A tool that allows students to create and upload their own video content to Panopto for sharing with peers or faculty in Canvas.
- **How it works**:
  - Students can record and upload video presentations or projects to Panopto, which are then automatically shared with specific Canvas courses or peers.
  - This could be part of collaborative projects, where students create educational videos or video assignments, and Panopto handles the storage and sharing of these resources.

### 7. **Transcript and Closed Captioning Integration**

- **Application**: Automatic generation of transcriptions or closed captions for videos hosted on Panopto, and the integration of these transcriptions into Canvas.
- **How it works**:
  - Panopto automatically generates captions for uploaded videos, ensuring accessibility for all students.
  - These transcriptions or captions can be made available to students directly within Canvas, alongside the videos, improving accessibility for students with hearing impairments or non-native speakers.

### 8. **Live Streaming of Events or Lectures**

- **Application**: Use Panopto to stream live lectures or guest speaker events and embed them in Canvas.
- **How it works**:
  - Panopto’s live streaming capabilities could be used to broadcast live events or lectures, which are then embedded within the Canvas course for live viewing or later access as recorded content.
  - Faculty or guest lecturers can interact with students via live chat or Q&A during the live stream, increasing engagement.

### 9. **Content Analytics for Faculty Improvement**

- **Application**: Use Panopto’s video analytics to provide feedback to instructors on how their video content is performing with students.
- **How it works**:
  - Instructors can view detailed analytics within Canvas on which videos students are watching, how much time they spend on each section, and any patterns in viewing behavior.
  - This data helps instructors improve their video content, re-edit sections that may be confusing, or add more targeted explanations to increase student understanding.

### 10. **Instructor-Facilitated Video Discussions**

- **Application**: A tool that facilitates video-based discussions where students watch a Panopto video and then participate in a discussion thread or video-based forum within Canvas.
- **How it works**:
  - After watching a video (e.g., a lecture, documentary, or guest speaker), students could be prompted to respond with video or text-based comments, leading to deeper engagement and peer interaction.
  - These discussions can be tied directly to assignments or learning objectives, encouraging reflection and analysis of the video content.
