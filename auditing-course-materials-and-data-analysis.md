# Auditing Course Materials and Data Analysis

> [!NOTE]
>
> ```Suggested primarily for use by Faculty, Staff and Admins to assess effectiveness and engagments.```
>
> We can create customized tools and reports that make it easier to monitor and manage courses while ensuring quality and compliance. These can be enhancements to exisiting Canvas features or new standalone tools.

### **1. Course Activity Audits**

- **What it does**: This feature tracks and logs all interactions within the course, including changes made to course materials, assignment submissions, student participation, and grading activities. It provides detailed records of who made each change and when it occurred.
- **Why it matters**: It gives faculty, staff, and administrators the ability to monitor course development and identify potential issues or discrepancies. This is especially useful for compliance, accreditation purposes, or internal quality assurance processes.

### **2. Materials Usage Reports**

- **What it does**: This tool or dashboard generates reports on how often course materials (e.g., lecture notes, videos, assignments) are accessed or downloaded by students. It can track which materials are engaging students the most and which may need to be updated or enhanced.
- **Why it matters**: Faculty and administrators can assess the effectiveness of course materials, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions about future course design.

### **3. Student Progress and Performance Reports**

- **What it does**: This tool generates reports on student progress, such as assignment completion rates, grades, participation levels, and overall course engagement. It provides insights into individual students and class-wide performance trends.
- **Why it matters**: Faculty and administrators can identify students who may need additional support, track progress toward course goals, and make timely adjustments to teaching strategies. This data is also useful for accreditation or institutional reporting.

### **4. Course Consistency Audits**

- **What it does**: This feature checks for consistency across multiple sections of the same course or across different instructorsâ€™ courses. It can flag inconsistencies in assignment deadlines, grading policies, or course content delivery.
- **Why it matters**: Administrators can ensure that courses are being taught consistently across the institution, maintain academic standards, and reduce confusion for students who may be taking multiple sections of the same course.

### **5. Accessibility Compliance Audits**

- **What it does**: This tool scans course materials for accessibility compliance (e.g., ensuring videos have captions, images have alternative text, and documents are screen-reader friendly). It generates reports highlighting areas where materials do not meet accessibility standards.
- **Why it matters**: Helps faculty ensure that all course materials are accessible to students with disabilities, ensuring compliance with accessibility laws and promoting inclusivity.

### **6. Custom Report Generation**

- **What it does**: Faculty, staff, and administrators can create custom reports based on specific needs, such as tracking student participation in specific activities, monitoring grading consistency, or comparing course performance across semesters.
- **Why it matters**: Custom reports provide tailored insights into different aspects of course management, making it easier to make informed decisions and track outcomes that matter most to specific departments or goals.

### **7. End-of-Term Reports**

- **What it does**: At the end of the semester, this tool generates comprehensive reports on course performance, student engagement, and grades, as well as insights into course materials and assignment effectiveness.
- **Why it matters**: Faculty and administrators can use these reports to assess the success of the course, identify areas of improvement for future terms, and contribute to overall course and program evaluation processes.

### **8. Faculty Collaboration and Feedback Reports**

- **What it does**: This tool aggregates feedback and course reviews from students and faculty collaborators to identify strengths and areas for improvement in course materials and teaching methods.
- **Why it matters**: Provides actionable feedback for instructors and departments, enabling continuous improvement in course design and delivery, as well as fostering faculty collaboration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### **Why These Auditing and Reporting Tools Matter**
>
> - **Enhanced Oversight**: Faculty, staff, and administrators gain the ability to monitor course activity and material usage, ensuring that courses are well-managed, consistent, and effective.
> - **Data-Driven Decisions**: Reports provide actionable insights into student performance, material effectiveness, and course design, helping instructors and administrators make informed decisions about course improvements and adjustments.
> - **Compliance and Accreditation**: Auditing tools ensure that the institution is compliant with accessibility standards and accreditation requirements, minimizing risks related to non-compliance.
> - **Continuous Improvement**: Regular audits and reports allow for ongoing course and teaching enhancement, fostering a culture of continuous improvement within the institution.
